The Colma BART Station is close to residential neighborhoods and shopping areas. Colma is perhaps best known for its 17 cemeteries, which comprise approximately 73% of the town's land area. The town incorporated in 1924 primarily to protect this land use. Colma's cemeteries represent numerous religious beliefs and nationalities, and include structures and districts which are historically significant on local, state and national levels.
